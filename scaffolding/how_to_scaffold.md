# Scaffolding with LLMs

**Pro Tip:** Don't write boilerplate from scratch. Ask an AI to do it.

## The Phrase to Use
"Generate a [Language] project structure with [Framework] that includes folders for [Folder List]."

## Example Prompts

### 1. The "Starter" Prompt
> "Create a minimal Node.js Express server. Include a `GET /health` endpoint and a comments array. Show me the folder structure I should use."

### 2. The "Structure" Prompt
> "I have an `index.js` file. Please refactor it so my routes are in `src/routes/` and my logic is in `src/controllers/`."

### 3. The "CLI" Approach
Many tools generate code for you:
- `npx create-react-app` (Legacy)
- `npm create vite@latest` (Modern Frontend)
- `npx express-generator` (Backend)

## Challenge
